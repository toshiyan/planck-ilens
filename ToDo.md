# Analysis improvement

-- Removing window-induced E-to-B leakage (cinv)
    -> a ~10% improvement on the error

-- Increasing realizations
    -> not so different (<< 1sigma)

-- Including kappa-CIB correlation
    -> Done

# Galactic foreground test

-- Different component separation: NILC
    -> increased to ~ 1sigma level
    
-- Different Galactic mask (G40)
    -> similar to G60 (<< 1sigma)

# Other test

-- rlmin dependence
    -> changed within << 1sigma (rlmin=200)

-- rlmax dependence
    -> changed within << 1sigma (rlmax=1900)

-- estimate impact of TP leakage
